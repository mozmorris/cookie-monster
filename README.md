Cookie Monster
==============

WordPress plugin that displays a fixed cookie information bar at the bottom of a WP site.

Description
-----------

The plugin hooks into WordPress and displays a cookie information bar at the bottom of the page.

The user can choose to allow or restrict cookies. Ironically, this sets a cookie named `cookie-pref` which is either true of false. **True** if the user has allowed cookies, **false** if the user wishes to restrict cookies. It's then up to you to detect this preference throughout your WordPress site and adjust functionality accordingly.

Installation
------------

1. Upload the `cookie-monster` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
